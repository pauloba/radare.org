<b> r2wars </b>

This game is inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War">coreWars</a>, but running on top of radare2's ESIL emulation. 
To win please submit your bots written in assembly (this time we will accept x86-32, arm64, arm32, mips) which will run in the same memory space trying to make the othe r bot crash by corrupting their memory.

<b> ctf </b> - capture the flag reversing challenges to solve with r2

The R2Con CTF is a Jeopardy style competition. 
You are given several questions, tasks & challenges related to different categories of RE which may be solved using radare2. 
Players get points by solving them. Using hints to solve the challenges lowers the score.


<b> GSOC </b>

This is the 7th Summer Of Code competition of radare2, this time we got accepted by Google in the GSoC, which allows us to bring the oportunity to some students to learn more about C, reverse engineering and r2 itself thanks to our mentoring. 
The selected students will be presenting their work at the end of summer during the r2con.
